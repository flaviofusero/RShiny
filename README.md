#### About Rivals of Aether
Rivals of Aether is one of my favourite platform fighter, allowing for great creativity and freedom in movement and combos, feauturing great graphics, animations and an overall lovely flavour. If you like the Super Smash Bros. series, I greatly encourage you to to try it.
