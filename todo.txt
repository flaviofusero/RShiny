TODO (fast)
- Numbers get sorted by text. I should split that
   TODO > put a "First Active Frame" column
- Add icons which tell you how stuff works
- Put kragg rocks inside his neutral special (i.e. modify input files)
- Write snap_to function in c++ to make click events faster?

TODO (will take time)
- Tool to visualize all blastzones, like https://tournameta.com/stage-comparison
