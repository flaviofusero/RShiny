TODO (fast)
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
- Add maxfall logic (relevant for spikes, etc.)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- Numbers get sorted by text. I should split columns
   TODO > put a "First Active Frame" column
- Output when an angle is 361 (Sakurai angle)

TODO (will take time)
- Put advanced options in the right sidebar
- Tool to visualize all blastzones, like https://tournameta.com/stage-comparison

NOT SURE HOW TO IMPLEMENT
- Overlay image on stages instead of only rectangles
- Spikes on stage

MAYBETOWN
- Add overheat bar for Elli attacks?
- Add dark mode?
- Put char icons instead of select input? (Need to figure out how and also would take more space...)
