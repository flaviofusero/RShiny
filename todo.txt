TODO (fast)
- parsecharmovesdata takes significant amount of time. Read workbook only once?
- Maybe put newlines after dots in characters' long notes
- Add icons which tell you how stuff works
- Numbers get sorted by text. I should split columns
   TODO > put a "First Active Frame" column

TODO (will take time)
- Tool to visualize all blastzones, like https://tournameta.com/stage-comparison

NOT SURE HOW TO IMPLEMENT
- Put image on stages instaed of only lines
- Spikes on stage
- Naked elliana

MAYBETOWN
- Write snap_to function in c++ to make click events faster? (Not urgent - it's not the bottleneck on Heroku...)
- Use Semantic UI
