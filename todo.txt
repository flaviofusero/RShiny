TODO (fast)
- Add maxfall logic (relevant for spikes, etc.)
- Numbers get sorted by text. I should split columns
   TODO > put a "First Active Frame" column
- Add "character stats" sheet

TODO (will take time)
- Tool to visualize all blastzones, like https://tournameta.com/stage-comparison

NOT SURE HOW TO IMPLEMENT
- Put image on stages instaed of only lines
- Spikes on stage

MAYBETOWN
- Write snap_to function in c++ to make click events faster? (Not urgent - it's not the bottleneck on Heroku...)
- Use Semantic UI
